# Incommensurate_Planewave.jl 

`Incommensurate_Planewave.jl` is a Julia package designed for the computation of the density of states (DoS) and local density of states (LDoS) for 1D and 2D incommensurate systems. 

Including:

- Plane wave method.
- Hamiltonian Construction.
- Eigenpair Computation.
- DoS and LDoS Computation.
